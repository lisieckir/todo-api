# Transitioning from PHP to C#

## Introduction
Hello! My name is Rafał Lisiecki and I am a developer with a strong background in PHP. I have decided to transition my career focus from PHP to C#. This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey, showcasing my progress, and sharing the projects I create as I learn C#.

## Background
I have been working with PHP for 9 years, during which I have developed a wide range of web applications and services. While I have enjoyed working with PHP, I am excited to expand my skill set and dive into the world of C# and .NET development.

## Goals
- To gain proficiency in C# and the .NET framework.
- To understand and implement object-oriented programming principles in C#.
- To build a portfolio of C# projects that demonstrate my skills and growth.
- To contribute to open-source C# projects and collaborate with the developer community.

## Resources
Here are some of the resources I am using to learn C#:
- [C# Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)
- [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/csharp-first-steps/)
- [Pluralsight C# Path](https://www.pluralsight.com/paths/csharp)

## Progress
I will be regularly updating this repository with new projects and code snippets as I continue to learn. Follow my journey and feel free to provide feedback or suggestions!
